  prompt="Have you been able to help someone through the gospel to face this difficulties? How we can show more love?\n\nYes, I have been able to help someone through the gospel to face their difficulties. I mostly did this on my mission, where I saw people, not matter how long they have been members, to face difficulties related to the gospel. I can show more love by being more understanding and compassionate towards them. I can also show love by being there for them and helping them through their struggles. It is incredible how much love and compassion can help someone through their difficult times.",
