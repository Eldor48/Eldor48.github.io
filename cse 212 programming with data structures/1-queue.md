# Queues

In Python, a queue is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner. This means that the data that is added to the queue first is the first to be removed. Queues are commonly used in computer programming to manage and organize data. In Python, the queue data structure can be implemented using the Queue class from the queue module. This class provides various methods for working with the queue, such as put() to add data to the queue and get() to retrieve data from the queue. Here is an example of how to create and use a queue in Python:

```
from queue import Queue

# Create a queue
q = Queue()

# Add data to the queue
q.put("data1")
q.put("data2")
q.put("data3")

# Retrieve data from the queue
data1 = q.get()
data2 = q.get()
data3 = q.get()

# Print the data
print(data1)  # Output: data1
print(data2)  # Output: data2
print(data3)  # Output: data3
