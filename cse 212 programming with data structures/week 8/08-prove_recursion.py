def count_ways_to_climb(s, remember = None):
    """
    Imagine that there was a staircase with 's' stairs.  
    We want to count how many ways there are to climb 
    the stairs.  If the person could only climb one 
    stair at a time, then the total would be just one.  
    However, if the person could choose to climb either 
    one, two, or three stairs at a time (in any order), 
    then the total possibilities become much more 
    complicated.  If there were just three stairs,
    the possible ways to climb would be four as follows:
    
        1 step, 1 step, 1 step
        1 step, 2 step
        2 step, 1 step
        3 step

	With just one step to go, the ways to get
    to the top of 's' stairs is to either:
    
    - take a single step from the second to last step, 
    - take a double step from the third to last step, 
    - take a triple step from the fourth to last step

    We don't need to think about scenarios like taking two 
    single steps from the third to last step because this
    is already part of the first scenario (taking a single
    step from the second to last step).

    These final leaps give us a sum:

    count_ways_to_climb(s) = count_ways_to_climb(s-1) + 
                             count_ways_to_climb(s-2) +
                             count_ways_to_climb(s-3)

    To run this function for larger values of 's', you will need
    to update this function to use memoization.  The parameter
    'remember' has already been added as an input parameter to 
    the function for you to complete this task.
    
    The last test case is commented out because it will not work
    until the memoization is implemented.

"""
A maze is defined as a list of lists.  The outer list
contains a representation of each row in the maze.  You can
assume that the maze will be square (same number of rows
and columns). The inner lists show what is in the maze:

0 = Wall (You can't go through this)
1 = Open Path (You can go through this)
2 = End (You want to get to this point to win)

See the Prove instructions for graphical representations of
the 2 test mazes defined below.

The 'is_end_maze' and the 'is_valid_move' functions are
already written for you.  These functions assume that the first
square in the maze is (0,0).  These functions also assume
that you can't leave the boundaries of the maze and that you 
can't visit the same square in the same path (no circles).

The 'curr_path' variable is a list of (x,y) tuples that 
represent the path we are currently on.  If you add a new position
to the path, make sure that you add the tuple to the list so that the
'is_valid_move' function works properly.

The goal is to implement the 'solve_maze' function to display
all paths to the end square using recursion.  When you find a path, 
then displaying will be as simple as 'print(curr_path)'.
