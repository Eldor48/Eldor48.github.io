          Anakin Skywalker was initially a Jedi Knight who was trained by Obi-Wan
          Kenobi and was prophesized to bring balance to the Force. However, he
          was seduced by the dark side of the Force and became the Sith Lord
          Darth Vader, serving as the enforcer of the Galactic Empire. He was
          responsible for many atrocities, including the destruction of the Jedi
          Order and the genocide of the planet Alderaan.

          hunting down the Rebel Alliance and attempting to capture Luke Skywalker, his own son.
          However, in the end, he is redeemed when he sacrifices himself to save
          Luke and defeat the Emperor, ultimately bringing balance to the Force
          as he was prophesized to do.
