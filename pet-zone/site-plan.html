      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/797779-ffffff-444444-505050"
        target="_blank"

          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>

          <td class="accent1">#444444</td>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>Heading Font: Roboto Mono</h4>
      <p>
        I choosed this font because I feel it is minimilist and makes you
        reading experience easier on the web page.

      </h4>
      <p>
        This font catched my attetion once I saw it in the library of google
        fonts. I beliebe it will capture the attetion of the people who will
        visit the web page.

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <h3>What kind of audience will be on my site?</h3>
      <p>
        In my web site plan one of the things I stated was that my I webpage
        would be directed to all kind of audiences, from people who are having
        their first pet, or for those who have a lot of experience and just got
        here out of curiosity. I will make the information pretty easy-to-read
        in my website, thinking in those people who have not experience with
        their pets or are not sure whether which kind of animal they want to
        get.

      <h3>Why people will visit my site?</h3>
      <p>
        My site will call people attention because of its simplicity. It will
        not have any complicated vocabulary, or some unnecessary steps that
        people need to go through in some other websites. Our goal is that as
        soon as you get in our site you can get your information in the fastest
        way possible, and exactly what you need. Nothing about unnecessary
        details, just what you need, and no more than that.

        inquiries and get more information from us. You will receive this
        information via e-mail. In this form you will be asked to put your name,
